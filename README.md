# Knowledge Graph Generation for Enhanced Chatbot and Scientific Literature Synthesis - Code4Earth challenge 24
The aim of the project is to create a knowledge graph for Scientific documents. This is linked directly to the challenge https://github.com/ECMWFCode4Earth/challenges_2024/issues/7



## Overview


## Features

List the main features and functionalities of the Knowledge Graph:

- Feature 1: Description
- Feature 2: Description
- ...

## Installation

To install necessary packages run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Neo4j :

We highly recommend you to use Neo4j Desktop if it is available for you due to its simplicity and UI interactions.

To run and use the app, you will need to install certain plugins of Neo4j :

#### APOC
More details here : https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/4.1/installation/

But, in brief, you can do as follow :

- APOC Core : APOC Core can be installed by moving the APOC jar file from the $NEO4J_HOME/labs directory to the $NEO4J_HOME/plugins directory and restarting Neo4j.
- Neo4j Desktop :APOC Full can be installed with Neo4j Desktop, after creating your database, by going to the Manage screen, and then the Plugins tab. Click Install in the APOC box and wait until you see the "Installed" message.

#### Graph-Data-Science

More details here : https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/installation/

Similar to APOC, you have several ways to install the library Graph-Data-Science :

- If you use Neo4j Desktop, you can install it from the UI, similarly to APOC
- If you run Neo4j in a Docker container, you need to configure the GDS library as a Neo4j Docker plugin
- If you use Neo4j Server (Community or Enterprise), you need to install the GDS library manually. Please follow the link above for more details !
