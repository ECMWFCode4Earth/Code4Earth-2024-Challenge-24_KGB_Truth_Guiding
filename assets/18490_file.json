This\ndocument describes what is presently archived by the operational model, illustrates the various \ufb01elds obtainable\nvia a MARS retrieval and explains how they should be interpreted.\n1\nConventions\nThe following conventions are employed in the storage of \ufb02uxes by the ECMWF model:\n1. Archived \ufb02uxes are either downward or net. Energy entering the Earth\u2019s atmosphere-surface system is taken\nas a positive quantity, and therefore downward \ufb02uxes are positive and net \ufb02ux refers to the downward \ufb02ux\nminus the upward \ufb02ux. To obtain the upward \ufb02ux (Fup) from the downward \ufb02ux (Fdn) and net \ufb02ux (Fnet),\nuse Fup = Fdn \u2212Fnet."
