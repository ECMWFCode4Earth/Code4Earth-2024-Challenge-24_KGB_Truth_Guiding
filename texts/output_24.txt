Assessing the impact of observations

because of an ad-hoc inflation of the observation errors introduced by Harnisch et al. (2013) to reproduce the 
large observed departure statistics near the tropical tropopause.  When this factor is reduced or removed, and 
the consistency between the real and simulated departure statistics is improved, the spread values show much 
better agreement.  
Overall, the results show that the simulated data provides a good approximation of how the real COSMIC-2 
data changes the spread values in the current EDA system. It is also worth emphasising that the real COSMIC-
2 measurements improve the estimate of the atmospheric state in the OSEs, but the simulated data does not, 
making the point that similar spread reductions do always not lead to the same forecast impact.  
 
Figure 11: The vertical profile of 12 hour forecast temperature spread reductions, comparing the 
impact of real (black) and simulated (green) COSMIC-2 measurements in the EDA. The results are 
given as a percentage of the temperature spread of the control experiment. The spread is computed 
for the period January 10 to February 10, 2020. The comparisons are limited to ±40 latitude band 
sampled by the COSMIC-2 data. The control experiment includes GNSS-RO measurements used 
operationally in this period.

Relationship between EDA spread and radiosonde departure statistics  
We have progressively added real GNSS-RO measurements in both OSEs and EDA simulations to investigate 
the relationship between the EDA spread changes and the OSE short-range forecast error statistics. Some of 
these results were presented to the SAC in 2021.  
The change of radiosonde short-range forecast departure statistics computed from OSEs are compared with 
the corresponding “raw” EDA spread values. More specifically, ignoring correlations between the observation 
and short-range forecast errors, it was assumed that the change in variance of the radiosonde departures, 𝜎($%&)
(

could be written as linear function of the EDA spread squared, 𝑠(, using
