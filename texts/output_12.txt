Summary 
For decades, medium-range weather forecasting has used the midlatitude geopotential height errors at 500 hPa 
as a main indicator of synoptic forecast quality. This can seem overly reductive. However, these errors are 
easy to measure, since they far outweigh any errors in the reference, and they rapidly outgrow the error 
covariance term that makes the choice of reference so important in the earlier forecast range. Finally, the 
medium-range forecast is an effective filter, taking whatever information is useful from the observations (in 
areas where the errors are rapidly growing) but ignoring observational information in areas that don’t matter 
(in areas of decaying errors). It is hard to measurably improve the medium-range synoptic forecast, due to the 
size of the chaotic variability, and due to the relatively small signals involved in high-baseline addition or 
denial experiments (Figure 1). But for these reasons, a statistically significant reduction in the day-5 
extratropical 500hPa geopotential height RMSE is an unambiguous signal that an observing system has a 
beneficial impact. Verification of the short-range forecasts, and of areas or fields with more complex error 
patterns, such as the stratosphere, the tropics, or clouds and humidity generally, is also important, but needs to 
be approached with much greater caution.   
2.2 
Forecast Sensitivity to Observation Impact (FSOI) 
Forecast Sensitivity to Observation Impact (FSOI, Langland and Baker, 2004) is an adjoint or ensemble-based 
method that enables the simultaneous assessment of how different groups of observations contributed to the 
reduction of a globally integrated, quadratic function of short-range forecast errors. It is argued that the reduced 
error in a 24-h forecast from the analysis, compared to the 36-h error forecast from the background, is due to 
the work done by the observations to improve the description of the atmospheric state. Using the adjoint (in 
the ECMWF implementation) of the forecast model, the forecast error differences, usually expressed as a total 
energy norm, are traced back in time (linearly) and attributed to individual observations according to their 
weight in the analysis, and relevance to the chosen metric. Given that FSOI relies on the use of a linearised 
version of the forecast model, it is only valid to evaluate short-range forecasts (0 to 48 hours, Janisková and 
Lopez, 2013). As discussed in the previous section, FSOI results at short-range can only be considered a partial 
indicator of medium-range forecast impact.   
The choice of forecast error measure, including the verifying reference, is an important aspect of the FSOI 
application, and it needs to be decided at the start of the FSOI calculations. Most NWP centres use a dry or 
moist total energy norm as an overall measure of forecast skill, obtained by verifying against the own analysis. 
The choice of dry or moist energy norm can have some impact on results and conclusions subsequently reached 
(Marquet et al., 2020), as it leads to different weighting of forecast errors across variables and levels. The 
choice of verifying reference can also have a significant impact on the results, as errors in the verifying analysis 
can confuse the interpretation of the impact of the observations. This can be due to biases in analysis and 
forecast, as well as correlated errors between analysis and forecast, and this problem is very similar to the 
issues highlighted earlier in the context of short-range forecast verification of OSEs. While the use of own-
analysis verification is most common for FSOI applications, Todling (2013) and Cardinali (2018) tested instead 
the use of an observation-based forecast error metric, to avoid some of these issues. Necessarily, results 
differed from the analysis-based FSOI, not least due to the geographical and geophysical sampling of the 
observing system and giving more weight to the stratosphere because of the satellite information the. At 
ECMWF, the default configurations used in operations applies the dry total energy norm to assess the impact 
on T+24 forecasts (Cardinali, 2009), using own-analysis verification, and the system is run twice daily based, 
using the long-window configuration of the HRES system.
