subsequently added in the EDA were nevertheless based on the full all-sky observation error model, with larger 
values in cloudy regions. The parameters for this error model were chosen in line with values used in the 
assimilation of real data. 
 
Figure 14: Increase in standard deviation of O-B (solid lines) with increasing presence of cloud 
signal for real Metop-A AMSU-A channel 5 data (black) and simulated small-satellite data for the 
equivalent channel (red). Low values of the cloud indicator indicate clear-sky regions, whereas 
increasing values indicate increasing presence of cloud signals. Crosses indicate the number of 
observations (right x-axis). Data are from the period 9-14 June 2018, over land surface only and 
from latitudes between 60ºN-60ºS. 
To test the sensitivity to the perturbations applied during the observation simulation, an additional EDA 
experiment using the Polar (8 satellite) constellation without these initial perturbations was also run. The 
observation error modelling applied in the EDA (and hence the perturbations applied in the EDA) were 
unchanged. Figure 15 shows a representative example that the effect of the initial perturbations applied has 
very little impact on the overall changes in EDA spread compared to the overall signal. It gives some further 
indication that the modelling of the perturbations applied during the simulation of the observations is a 
secondary influence on the EDA spread, at least as long as these perturbations are smaller than the perturbations 
subsequently added in the EDA.
