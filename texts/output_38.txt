measurements anchor the system because they can be assimilated without bias correction, but this key 
measurement characteristic is not captured in the EDA assessment. In contrast, the microwave measurements 
will require bias correction and they are assimilated with VarBC so that they are not treated as anchor 
measurements, but biases are not currently applied in the simulation process.  
The present EDA studies focus on changes in the spread at short-range, and interpret this as a partial predictor 
of medium-range forecast impact. The EDA experiments can provide an estimate of medium-range impact, 
and we have found that simulated and real COSMIC-2 measurements produce similar spread reductions at 
day-5 which is encouraging (Figure 19). However, the interpretation of such results is complicated by the fact 
that singular vectors are required to produce a reliable ensemble at medium-range. For this reason, we consider 
short-range results to be most robust. The emphasis on short-range impact is in common with the use of FSOI, 
which also is strictly only applicable to characterise short-range impact. 
In principle, well calibrated OSSEs potentially provide more information on the medium-range impact of new 
observing systems, but developing and maintaining a well calibrated OSSE system, which also keeps pace 
with the evolving global observing system, is a major challenge. It is probably easier to test the impact of new 
observations on top of the latest global observing system with the EDA, because it is used in operations and it 
will include the latest observations. However, we do not see the EDA and OSSEs as in direct competition. It 
is important to recognise that the impact of new observations will vary depending on the details of the 
implementation in each NWP system. Having access to both OSSEs and EDA estimations from different 
systems (and possibly other methods, like Sensitivity Observing System Experiments, Marseille et al., 2008) 
should help isolate system dependent aspects from the real impact, and provide better overall guidance to the 
agencies. The recent OSSE results from Privé et al. (2022) illustrate this point. Adding GNSS-RO clearly 
degrades winds in the tropical stratosphere in that system (their Figure 16), but this not case in either the EDA 
experiments or OSEs with real GNSS-RO, so this apparent degradation should be ignored. This kind of 
problem is easy to spot for an existing observing system where OSEs are available, but it will be much harder 
for completely new observation types, so multiple approaches should be useful. In this context, we note that 
the assessments of the future DWL system coordinated by EUMETSAT, will include both ECMWF EDA 
estimates with OSSEs performed with the NOAA system. Similarly, an OSSE will be performed by Météo-
France for the EPS-Sterna constellation, in addition to the EDA experimentation planned at ECMWF.  
To date, we have used the EDA to assess potentially large changes to the global observing system, but usually 
involving just one observation type which is already used operationally and well understood. Going forward, 
the impact of different observing systems will be compared with the EDA, for instance in the context of the 
DWL and EPS-Sterna constellation work mentioned earlier. Doing so will implicitly assume that the EDA 
response reflects the short-range forecast uncertainty in a similar way for the two observing systems 
considered. As noted above, this aspect requires further investigation, for instance by conducting EDA 
experimentation with real data for the different observing systems over the same period and in the same system. 
At times, space agencies are also interested in more subtle questions for specific instrument design, such as 
how changes in horizontal resolution or sampling for a MW instrument affects the results, or what benefit the 
addition of a specific channel brings. Such questions are very difficult to answer with the EDA method (or 
indeed OSSEs), either as our modelling and assimilation of the observations is not sophisticated enough to 
assess such details, or as the signals are likely to be small, and uncertainties in the EDA method may dominate. 
We consider the EDA method to be best suited for relatively sizeable changes to the observing system.
