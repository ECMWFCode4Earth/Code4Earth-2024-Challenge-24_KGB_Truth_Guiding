Assessing the impact of observations

Technical Memorandum No. 916 
 
The EDA simulations to be conducted will build on and complement the work presented in Section 4.4, and 
results are expected to contribute to the required trade-off analyses. A particularly novel aspect will be 
estimating the impact of the new 325 GHz channels which are similar to channels to be flown on the Ice Cloud 
Imager on EPS-SG, but are not currently available from space.  
Future Doppler Wind Lidar  
The Aeolus Doppler Wind Lidar (DWL) did not meet the pre-launch mission requirements, but the horizontal 
line of site (HLOS) winds have had a significant positive impact in NWP systems (Rennie et al., 2021).  
An operational follow-on DWL mission is being considered, and Phase 0 of preparation activities started at 
ESA and EUMETSAT in 2020. Consolidated requirements are also currently being compiled. It seems 
reasonable to expect that a future DWL mission will improve upon the Aeolus performance in terms of HLOS 
quality. Therefore, it is useful to estimate how this anticipated improvement will translate into an additional 
DWL impact in an NWP system. The EDA approach will be used to test this. One simulated DWL dataset will 
be produced with noise characteristics consistent with the actual Aeolus performance, and the other will be 
based on the expected performance of the future DWL system.   
Future MW-sounding systems from NOAA  
In addition, a further EDA-activity will be done in collaboration with NOAA and the Cooperative Institute for 
Satellite Earth System Studies (CISESS). The aim will be to evaluate the NWP benefit from a future MW 
sounder that is being considered by NOAA as a follow-on to the ATMS instrument, with added channel 
capabilities in the 118 GHz band. The study will consider the impact of such an instrument in the 13:30 and 
5:30 orbits, and relate this impact to that of the MW sounders on the current heritage POES satellites as well 
as that of ATMS.

Summary 
This paper has reviewed and summarised approaches used at ECMWF to evaluate the benefit of observations 
in global NWP. The main emphasis has been on evaluating the expected impact of future observations for 
which ECMWF has established a 4D-Var information-content approach that builds on the operational EDA 
system. However, we have also reviewed methodological aspects of the use of OSEs and FSOI for measuring 
impact of existing observations, as well as key features of the performance of the ECMWF EDA. 
The global observing system is evolving, and OSEs are considered the gold-standard for evaluating the present 
impact of real observations. ECMWF complements this with FSOI evaluations for diagnostic purposes. Recent 
OSEs have highlighted challenges in terms of reliable verification of short-range forecast impact, and they 
exhibit a healthy robustness and resilience of the global system to denying single observing systems for NWP. 
Given the current state of the global observing system, it is increasingly important to optimise the 
complementarity of different future systems and to evaluate opportunities offered by new technology. OSEs 
and FSOI can provide important insights into how the global observing system should evolve, but simulations 
of the future impact of specific observing systems are an important ingredient for achieving such an optimised 
design.
