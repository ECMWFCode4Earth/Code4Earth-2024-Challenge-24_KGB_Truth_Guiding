Assessing the impact of observations

adding MW sounding data has been demonstrated in observing system experiments with existing observations 
(Duncan et al., 2021), raising some expectation that further improvements in temporal sampling would lead to 
further benefits. Developments in satellite and sensor technology make it feasible to launch MW sounding 
instruments on small satellites or even cube-sats, thus making such constellations a possibility, as a 
complement to the backbone global observing system.  
The study considered different orbit and instrument scenarios to probe two key aspects of the constellation 
design: how the impact varies with the number/ distribution of satellites, and the relative benefits of different 
sets of channels (183 GHz humidity-sounding only or with additional temperature sounding in the 50 GHz 
band). The constellations vary in size between 8 and 20 satellites, and the orbital planes are optimised to 
complement four existing MW sounders in the 9:30 (Metop) and 13:30 (JPSS) orbits (Table 1), part of the 
CGMS backbone constellation. Hypothetical instrument payloads were considered, with channels based on 
sub-sets of channels envisaged for the Arctic Weather Satellite. 
Table 1: Satellite constellations with MW sounding considered. In the real-data cases, combinations 
of AMSU-A/MHS or ATMS were normally used, with the exception of the 5th orbit in the 
Metop/JPSS+ constellation, for which a combination of the NOAA-15 AMSU-A and the F-17 SSMIS 
was used (both in approximately a 6:30 orbit during the study period). For each constellation with 
MW sounding data, separate EDA experiments were run with humidity-sounding channels 
assimilated only, and with temperature and humidity-sounding channels assimilated.  
(*) Strictly, 8 satellites with real data are used, though only 7 sets of temperature + humidity 
sounding capabilities.
