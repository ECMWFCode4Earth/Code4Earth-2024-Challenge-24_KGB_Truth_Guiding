Figure 1: Standard deviation of Analysis error as a function of the number of observations. Here, 
the background error is 1 unit and each observation has an error of 1 unit, with no error correlations 
or biases. If 10 observations represent the current global observing system, then the orange line 
shows a denial experiment and the green line an addition experiment. The red line represents a low 
baseline addition experiment. As more observations are added, their individual impact reduces. 
A fundamental difficulty with measuring changes in the observing system is that analysis and short-range 
forecast error statistics are expected to reduce following the inverse of the square root  of the number of 
observations (See Figure 1, assuming all observations have the same error and are uncorrelated). A small 
modification within a much larger observing system typically makes only a small impact on the analysis and 
forecast error statistics, as illustrated in the addition and denial examples in Figure 1. This makes it hard to 
distinguish the signal of the change in the observing system from the natural chaotic noise in any weather 
forecast (Geer, 2016).  
Some studies try to circumvent this by performing low baseline, poorer quality experiments, represented by 
the red line in Figure 1. This seeks to exclude most other observations in order to get a larger signal from 
adding the observing system of interest. A typical low baseline includes conventional data plus observations 
from one satellite, but incorrectly uses settings that have been tuned with the full observing system, such as 
the background error (e.g. Kelly et al., 2008). This can give insufficient weight to the observations under test, 
though Duncan et al. (2021) showed that for smaller, but still significant perturbations of the observing system 
(no microwave sounders), the issue of background errors is less important. The issue of an incorrect 
background error can also be overcome using an analysis reinitialization approach, where the background 
always comes from the full observing system (see Geer et al., 2014). However, these are not the only issues 
with the low baseline approach. A sub-optimal observing system, for example one with an uncorrected bias, 
might be able to show a beneficial impact on top of a low baseline system, but this impact is probably 
overestimated, and in the worst case the new data could degrade the analysis when added to a more complete 
observing system. Conversely, observations sensitive to nonlinear processes like cloud and precipitation may 
cause problems in a system where the background is too far from the truth, whereas they might be used more
