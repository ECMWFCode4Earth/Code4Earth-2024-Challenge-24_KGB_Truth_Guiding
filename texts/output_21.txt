Assessing the impact of observations

The failure to achieve saturation was explained by the assumed GNSS-RO uncertainty model, where all 
vertical and horizontal GNSS-RO error correlations were assumed to be zero. It was argued that even perfectly 
correlated observations, with uncorrelated observation errors, will appear to provide useful information in the 
EDA system, because the additional observations effectively reduce the random measurement errors through 
repetition. It was also recognised that the concept of ‚Äúsaturation‚Äù was ambiguous, particularly when 
assimilating observations with uncorrelated errors. For example, in the idealised scalar case shown in Figure 
1, the standard deviation of the analysis error scales as 1/‚àö1 + ùëõ, and this will continue to fall as more data is 
added, albeit with a reduced rate, so ‚Äúsaturation‚Äù is difficult to define objectively.   
The study concluded that there was a good case to increase the GNSS-RO numbers, but also encouraged work 
on OSSEs to test this further. Recent GNSS-RO OSSEs by Priv√© et al. (2022) have now shown that the GNSS-
RO impact does not saturate at 100,000 occultations per day in their system. The Harnisch results informed an 
International Radio Occultation Working Group (IROWG) target of 20,000 occultations per day. Recent results 
showing the benefits of assimilating additional GNSS-RO from both COSMIC-2 and Spire suggest it was a 
reasonable target (Figure 7, Figure 10).   
However, it must be acknowledged that if we reran the Harnisch study today, we would not achieve the 
percentage reductions in spread shown in Figure 9, which are only valid for the NWP system and observation 
usage in July-August, 2008. This is because the background EDA spread values have reduced since 2008, 
primarily because the total number of observations assimilated has increased over the period (although other 
improvements to the NWP system will also have an impact). In 2008, the number of observations assimilated 
per day was below 10 million, but by 2020 it exceeded 30 million. The ‚Äúno RO‚Äù 12-hour temperature spread 
values at 100 hPa are now around 0.15-0.2 K lower than in the 2008, which is a ~20-30 % spread reduction. 
We have also increased the assumed GNSS-RO error statistics used to assimilate the data. Consequently, the 
additional GNSS-RO measurements will have a lower information content today, in both an absolute and 
relative sense, because other observations are providing more information and GNSS-RO slightly less. This 
highlights potential problems that will arise if we try to compare spread reductions from different EDA 
experiments. The information content of the new observations will depend on the quality of the NWP system, 
resolution and observations used in the control experiment, and this must be common in any comparisons.
