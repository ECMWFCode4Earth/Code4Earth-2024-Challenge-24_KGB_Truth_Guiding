EDA spread results for different constellation choices  
Figure 16 illustrates some of the key results in terms of the EDA spread reduction for the constellations 
considered as a function of the number of sounding locations assimilated. Reductions are shown relative to a 
system in which all MW sounding data were denied, but otherwise the full real observing system was used. 
The data point furthest to the left represents the Metop/JPSS baseline using real data. The next two datapoints 
depict the spread reduction resulting from adding three existing MW sounders to this baseline (Metop/JPSS+), 
either with humidity-sounding capabilities only (red) or with temperature and humidity sounding (black). The 
remaining datapoints show spread reductions from adding instead simulated data from the potential future 
constellations considered, again either with humidity-sounding (red) or temperature- and humidity-sounding 
capabilities (black). The trend of the data points from adding simulated data extends smoothly from those using 
only real observations. This is an important and very reassuring result which adds further confidence in the 
simulations. 
 
Figure 16: Percentage EDA spread reductions with increasing observation numbers for geopotential 
height at 500 hPa from a baseline with no MW sounder data for all constellation options and 
baselines. Black and red symbols indicate respectively the addition of temperature and humidity 
sounding channels or humidity channels only to the Metop/JPSS baseline. Different symbols denote 
the different simulated data scenarios or the use of real MW data where the additional “Polar++ 
RT” refers to the reduced thinning sensitivity experiment (see main text). Data are from the Northern 
Hemisphere (latitude > 20°) over the period 8-28 June 2018. 
Some key points are readily apparent from Figure 16, providing relevant guidance for the constellation design:  
1. There is continued benefit from adding MW sounding data, within the range covered, and even the 
smallest constellation considered (“Polar”, ie 8 satellites in 4 orbital planes) brings sizeable
