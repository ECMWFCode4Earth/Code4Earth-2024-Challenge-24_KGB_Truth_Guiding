Abstract 
 
We review the assessment of existing observations with Observing System Experiments (OSEs) and the 
Forecast Sensitivity to Observation Impact (FSOI) approach. Although care is needed when interpreting their 
results, the information they provide is largely consistent. The Ensemble of Data Assimilations (EDA) provides 
an affordable and manageable framework for simulating the impact of future observing systems. Recent 
experience comparing EDA predictions with the subsequent impact of real measurements gives us some 
confidence that, with appropriate interpretation and care, they provide useful information that can help guide 
the future evolution of the global observing system. 
Plain Language Summary 
 
This “Special Topic Paper” was originally presented to the ECMWF Science Advisory Committee (SAC) in 
October 2022. It has been reproduced here, with minor editorial changes, as an ECMWF Technical 
Memorandum to enable broader access to the document.  
The central question addressed in the paper is: How can we predict the potential impact of future observations 
on the quality weather forecasts produced with numerical weather prediction systems? This is clearly 
fundamental when trying to plan how the global observing system (GOS) should evolve, but it is extremely 
difficult to address in practice. To provide appropriate context, this paper starts by reviewing how the impact 
of the current, real observations is assessed, emphasising that this apparently straightforward task requires 
considerable skill and care when interpreting the results. We then discuss the use of ensemble methods 
introduced by ECMWF in 2007 designed to predict the impact of the future observations on theoretical 
estimates of analysis and short-range forecast error statistics. The strengths and weaknesses of these ensemble 
methods are discussed, and examples using both current, real and future satellite observations are presented.
