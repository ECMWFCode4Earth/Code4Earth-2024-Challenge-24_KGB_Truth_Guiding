where ideally the intercept, ùëê, should be related to the radiosonde observation error statistics. An example is 
shown in Figure 12, for the tropics at 100 hPa where the GNSS-RO information content is high.  
 
  
Figure 12: The variance of radiosonde short-range forecast temperature departures at 100 hPa in 
the tropics from the OSEs, versus EDA spread variance, as the number of GNSS-RO measurements 
is increased. 
In general, the linear model is a good representation of the spread-skill relationship in the lower/middle 
stratosphere up to 10 hPa, but as noted by the SAC in 2021, the gradient values, ùëö, tend to be too large, and 
in some cases the computed offset, ùëê, can be negative, implying a negative radiosonde uncertainty value. The 
gradient values in the stratosphere are typically in the range m=5-11, depending on level and region. We obtain 
similar results when we compare the EDA spread values with the departure statistics of the EDA control 
member, so the resolution difference between the OSE and EDA does not account for this.   
The EDA system is under-dispersive (Section 3.2), so it is expected that the absolute impact of the GNSS-RO 
will be underestimated. As discussed in Section 3.2, a global scaling factor of 1.34 is currently applied to 
derive background error standard deviations from the raw EDA spread, so introducing a factor of 1.8 
(=1.34() in the m values would be consistent with this. However, this factor has been derived primarily to 
optimise 4D-Var forecast performance, rather than to calibrate spread/skill relationships for specific levels. 
The factors found here are more in line with results from an evaluation of spread/skill relationships for 
radiosonde temperature departures obtained by Bormann and Bonavita (2013, see their Figure 4), albeit using 
an older EDA system over a different period. In their study, they noted that different scaling factors were 
applicable to different observations, and scaling factors required for AMSU-A channels 8-9 were much lower 
than for radiosondes in the same vertical interval. One interpretation is that the EDA represents uncertainty at
