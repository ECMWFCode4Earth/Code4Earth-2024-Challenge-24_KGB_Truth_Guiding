complicates direct comparisons between EDA spread reductions and the improved forecast scores computed 
in OSEs. 
 
Figure 10: The impact of assimilating Spire (black), COSMIC-2 (red) and (Spire+COSMIC-2) 
(green) on Z500 RMSE scores. The control experiment includes all measurements used 
operationally. Removing all GNSS-RO from the control is also shown (blue). Verification is against 
own analysis (a) and against operational analysis (b), noting the different vertical scales. 
4.3.1. 
Consistency of real and simulated COSMIC-2 observations in the EDA  
One important new result is a comparison of the impact of real and simulated COSMIC-2 GNSS-RO 
measurements in the EDA system. The Harnish study established that similar numbers of real and simulated 
GNSS-RO data had a similar impact in the EDA, but the new results are a more systematic study. This is done 
by simulating GNSS-RO measurements at the observed COSMIC-2 times and locations, using the ECMWF 
operational analyses with the bending angle simulation code and the observation uncertainty model developed 
in the Harnisch study.  
Figure 11 shows vertical profiles of the 12-hour forecast temperature spread reductions obtained with both real 
and simulated COSMIC-2 data. Overall, the agreement between the real and simulated data is very good, and 
we also see similar levels of consistency for geopotential, wind and relative humidity. These results suggest 
that the simplifications and approximations in the GNSS-RO simulation process (Section 4.1.3) do not have a 
significant impact on the EDA spread estimates, and that we are able to predict the performance of real GNSS-
RO data in the EDA reasonably accurately.  
There are some small differences in the tropics, with the simulated data giving larger spread reductions in the 
troposphere, and smaller reductions above 100 hPa. The differences in the troposphere are still under 
investigation, but they may be related to a lack of vertical error correlations in the simulated data. In the tropical 
stratosphere, we have found that the simulated (o-b) departures are too large when compared to real data
