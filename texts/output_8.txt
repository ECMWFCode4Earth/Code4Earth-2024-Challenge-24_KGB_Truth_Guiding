Importance of the reference 
Since there is no perfect reference, it is good practice to verify against both observations and analyses. In the 
research department it is common to use the statistics of background departures. Since these are calculated 
across the global observing system, it would be hard to find a more comprehensive set of observations for 
validation. The downside is that background departures are only routinely computed for the 12-hour forecast. 
It also means that verification is being done in the observation space, even if that is satellite radiances or 
bending angles, which need expertise to interpret. Direct observations of the forecast variables, such as 
radiosonde temperature or surface pressure, can be more easily used in observational verification at all forecast 
ranges, but these have the limitations of incomplete coverage (often dominated by highly populated areas of 
the northern hemisphere) and the relatively large errors in the observations themselves.  
 
Figure 2: Forecast error in 850 hPa relative humidity in the tropics (20°N to 20°S) as a function of 
forecast day, computed against the operational HRES analysis (solid) or the experiment’s own 
analysis (dashed). Against own-analysis, the apparent 0-hour forecast error is zero; 0-hour forecast 
error against the operational analysis was estimated from earlier studies to save time (Geer et al., 
2010). 
Verification against analysis has the advantage of complete coverage and of being based on the statistically 
best estimate of the atmospheric state. However, the results can be dominated by the error covariance term 
between the errors in the forecast and the errors in the reference (see also appendix for further details). Hence 
the choice of analysis to use as a reference is important. An extreme example of the problem is seen in the 
humidity field in the tropics (Figure 2). At a 12-hour forecast range, the RMSE is around 40 % smaller when 
computed against the experiment’s own analysis than when it is calculated against the operational analysis. 
Since the 12-hour forecast is used as the background in the data assimilation, the resulting analysis is strongly 
correlated with the 12-hour forecast. Another way to think about this is that 12-hour RMSE computed against 
own analysis is also a measure of the size of the data assimilation increments. The effect of adding new 
observations is often to increase the size of the increments, reduce correlations between forecast and analysis, 
and hence to apparently increase the size of the RMSE (e.g. Bouttier and Kelly, 2001; Geer and Bauer, 2010).
