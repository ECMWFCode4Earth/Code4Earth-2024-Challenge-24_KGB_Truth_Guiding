data were thinned spatially, selecting only one observation within a 110 km distance per half-hourly time-slots. 
This is to limit the effect of spatially correlated observation errors which we can currently not account for 
during the assimilation. In addition, data from all satellites of the hypothetical future constellation were thinned 
together (following the AMSU-A approach), resulting in many observations being thinned out at higher 
latitudes where there is most overlap. The thinning practice is the reason why the increase in the number of 
data points shown in Figure 16 for the different constellations is not as large as might be expected given the 
increase in the number of satellites. The effect of this was particularly severe as the phasing of the satellites in 
the small-satellite constellations was not optimised to avoid this.  
To investigate the role of thinning all satellites of the constellation together, we also ran a pair of EDA 
sensitivity experiments in which we assimilated the largest, Polar++ constellation with the satellites spatially 
thinned separately rather than all together. This most extreme point in the number of observations in Figure 16 
suggests that it is possible to approach a point where the benefit from additional measurements slows 
considerably (see “Polar++ RT”). Note, however, that the additional data here comes from observing a similar 
location at a similar time, and hence the only mechanism to provide further information is effective noise 
reduction, rather than the observation of temporally evolving structures. This likely explains at least partly the 
lack of further spread decrease for the humidity-only scenario, as instrument noise is not considered a limiting 
factor for these observations. The comparison also highlights the sensitivity of the EDA results to practical 
assimilation choices and assumptions on error characteristics, an important element to keep in mind when 
interpreting the results.

Comparing EDA spread reductions and OSE results 
The four EDA experiments with real observations also allowed a comparison of the EDA spread reductions 
and forecast error reductions in a similar way as presented in Section 4.3.2 for the GNSS-RO work. The 
measure of short-range forecast error was again the variance of background departures for radiosondes. As for 
the GNSS-RO results, in general there is a trend for increasing variance of the radiosonde O-B with variance 
of the EDA spread such as in the examples shown in Figure 18. While the low number of data points limits 
interpretation, many levels/regions show a broadly linear relationship, though this is less clear for the 
troposphere in the tropics, where the signal in the EDA spread reduction is weaker. The broadly linear 
relationship again highlights that there is a reasonable agreement between the EDA and the OSEs in these 
areas, at least for relative forecast impacts. Nevertheless, the slope and intercepts of the regression lines vary 
between pressure levels and variables within the MW study, with slopes for temperature in the range of 1.1-
2.2 over the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropics and 1-7 elsewhere. Results for wind are broadly similar. As 
discussed in Section 4.3.2, the recognised under-spread of the EDA is likely a factor why the forecast error 
reduction measured by radiosondes is larger than the EDA spread reduction, as indicated by slope-values larger 
than one.
