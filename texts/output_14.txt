for a prototype satellite, reflecting the relative sparsity of wind data, especially in the tropics. In Figure 7 the 
20-day mean values still show some noise, partly due to fluctuations in observation numbers, but much of it 
can be considered as random. Overall, in situ observations (densest in the northern hemisphere) tend to have 
slightly larger FSOI in the boreal winter than the summer, reflecting slightly larger background errors in winter. 
Over the last eight or so years (not shown) there has been a strong increase in the impact of microwave data, 
especially the humidity channels (MWWV, black in Figure 7) with the addition of several instruments and the 
move to all-sky radiance assimilation (Geer et al., 2017).

Conceptually, FSOI and OSEs are very different, and they are usually seen as complementary pieces of 
information. OSEs measure the cumulative impact of removing (or adding) observation subsets, including any 
effect via adjustments to bias correction, whereas FSOI gives results linearised about the ‘all observations’ 
states. Therefore, FSOI does not measure the impact of removing the observation type from the system. For 
example, if an observing system provides 20% in FSOI, this does not mean that forecast errors will increase 
by 20% if it is removed. The DA system will automatically re-tune, giving more weight to other observations 
by taking account of the degradation of the background, and the loss of skill may be smaller. The different 
behaviours of OSEs and FSOI have been highlighted by Eyre (2021). The OSE results are more resilient to the 
removal of observational information from well-observed variables, but not when denied from poorly observed 
variables. 
As in the case of OSEs, FSOI results will depend on the maturity of the NWP system used, including the 
number and diversity of observing systems assimilated. Two different NWP systems may give very different 
results. In the case of FSOI, an important caveat is that results are very sensitive to assigned observation errors.
