Assessing the impact of observations

against the operational analysis gives an inflated estimate of the degradation caused by removing observing 
system components, out to at least day-3. As the forecast range increases, due to rapid error growth in the 
midlatitudes, the true errors in the forecast become relatively large compared to the errors in the reference or 
the error correlation term (Eq. A3, see Appendix) so the choice of reference becomes less important in the 
longer-range forecast. For the most reliable forecast evaluation at short forecast ranges, it is typical to favour 
observation-based measures as the most reliable verification reference.

Growth of forecast errors

tropics (dashed). 
The atmosphere is a dynamic system with sensitive dependence on initial conditions, in other words a chaotic 
system. In the midlatitudes, baroclinic errors grow rapidly over the first 10 days of the forecast (Figure 4, solid 
line) and start to saturate beyond this. However, in the tropics, error growth is much slower but shows little 
sign of saturation (Figure 4, dashed line). As discussed, this means that true forecast errors in the tropics do 
not always dominate the errors in the reference or the covariance term between the forecast error and the 
reference error (Eq. A3, see Appendix). Also, the bias term can be much more important (Eq. A2). A 
consequence of chaotic error growth, particularly in the extra-tropics, is that even the smallest perturbation in 
the system can grow into a large synoptic-scale error. The EDA uses this effect to generate multiple different 
realisations of the possible analysis using perturbed observations and a perturbed model, and even a purely 
technical perturbation to the system can generate a similar effect (e.g. Geer, 2016).
