Background 
This Special Topic Paper was originally presented to ECMWF’s Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) in 
October 2022. It has been reproduced here as an ECMWF Technical Memorandum, with minor editorial 
changes, to enable broader access to the SAC document. 
The ECMWF Strategy 2021-2030 states: 
“ECMWF will continue to strengthen its key role, in collaboration with space agencies and the WMO, 
to define and support long-term visions for global observing system developments.” 
Observing System Experiments (OSEs) and Forecast Sensitivity to Observation Impact (FSOI) methods are 
used to assess the impact of current observations, and they can provide important insights into how the global 
observing system (GOS) should evolve (e.g. WMO, 2020). However, the long-term vision for the GOS also 
requires estimating the information content and potential forecast impact of future observing systems, 
sometimes before the instruments are developed. An assessment of this type will usually be based on simulated 
(or “synthetic”) observations. The most established approach for estimating forecast impact with simulated 
observations is to run Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) (e.g. Errico and Privé, 2018). These 
are significant computational exercises, requiring both the integration of a high resolution “nature run” (NR), 
which is used as a proxy for the true atmospheric state, and the simulation of all existing observing systems.  
Whilst ECMWF routinely supports OSSEs through the provision of the NRs, it does not conduct them. 
Running OSSEs at ECMWF would require significant resources.  However, in recent years, we have developed 
an alternative, computationally cheaper method for assessing new observing systems, using an Ensemble of 
Data Assimilations (EDA) technique. This approach estimates how the new observations reduce the statistical 
uncertainty in the analyses and short-range forecasts.  
Tan et al. (2007) pioneered the method, showing that the assimilation of simulated Aeolus measurements in 
an EDA system reduced the ensemble “spread”, and that this spread reduction could be used to estimate the 
impact of the Aeolus measurements. The EDA approach was subsequently used to estimate how the impact of 
GNSS-RO scales with observation number (Harnisch et al., 2013), and this work informed the 20,000 
occultation per day target, currently adopted by the International Radio Occultation Working Group (IROWG).  
In 2021, the SAC noted:   
"The SAC welcomes and supports the active role ECMWF plays in the preparation for future 
satellites, often in cooperation with satellite agencies, and evaluation of new data sets and their 
impacts. The SAC recognises the potential of using the EDA method to assess the contribution of 
existing and future observing system. However, like for other methods measuring impact, the 
interpretation needs to consider the limitations of the EDA calibration as well as the constraints of 
the configuration used for performing the evaluation of the existing or future observing system." 
A key aim of this paper is to outline our current interpretation and understanding of the strengths and 
weaknesses of the EDA assessment technique, based on recent and ongoing studies.  Clearly, it is important to 
engage with the space agencies on these matters when requested, but we must also be clear about the limitations 
in the information we provide.
