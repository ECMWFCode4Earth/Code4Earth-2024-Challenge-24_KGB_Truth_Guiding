broader vertical scales more accurately than at the fine vertical scales, and this may be one explanation for the 
scaling factors observed here. However, this interpretation still requires further investigation. 
The EDA only provides an estimate of the random error statistics, but the GNSS-RO measurements also have 
an additional role as anchor measurements within the NWP system. It is difficult to isolate the additional value 
of this anchoring in the EDA computations, but it may improve the radiosonde temperature departure statistics 
by correcting spatially varying biases. Figure 13 illustrates the size and spatial variability of the mean 
temperature analysis differences at 100 hPa, comparing all RO minus no RO. These changes in the mean state 
are large when compared to the changes in the EDA spread values.

Summary of recent GNSS-RO work 
The assimilation of real COSMIC-2 and Spire observations has a clear positive impact. Importantly, we have 
found that real and simulated COSMIC-2 observations have a similar impact on the EDA spread. The 
improvements in radiosonde departure statistics indicate that the changes in the EDA spread underestimates 
the absolute impact of the GNSS-RO measurements in the lower/middle stratosphere. The global scaling factor 
used to inflate the raw EDA spread values for operational applications does not resolve this problem, and 
further work is required (See also Figure 18).

Constellations of small satellites carrying microwave sounders 
The most recent application of the EDA-method is to estimate the expected impact from potential future 
constellations of small satellites carrying microwave (MW) sounding instruments, as part of an ESA-funded 
study (Lean et al., 2021a, b). The aim of such a constellation is to provide higher temporal sampling than 
currently available. This is expected to be beneficial to observe fast-evolving cloud and humidity features, but 
also to reduce the effective observation noise through higher measurement numbers. The continued benefit of
