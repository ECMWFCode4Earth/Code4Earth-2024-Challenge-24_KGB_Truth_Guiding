Assessing the impact of observations

Since FSOI provides an impact measure for individual observations, it can be aggregated in any way, and this 
is a particularly attractive feature. It allows affordable detailed analyses for multiple observation types, and 
also subsets of observations, such as individual stations or channels of an instrument, specific geographical 
regions, observed variables, etc. Results are typically reported either as total FSOI for a particular observation 
set, or as FSOI per observation. Some aggregation is needed, because individual values are noisy. In this 
context, FSOI suggests that just over 50% of the observations have positive impact, reflecting the statistical 
nature of FSOI (Lorenc and Marriott, 2014). As a result, a thorough interpretation of FSOI results should 
include statistical significance testing. 
FSOI can be particularly useful for assessing the value of remote observations which are considered 
meteorologically important, but are difficult to assess in OSEs, as the size of the impact signal will be 
comparatively small and localised. For example, in support of the WMO Systematic Observations Financing 
Facility (SOFF https://public.wmo.int/en/our-mandate/how-we-do-it/development-partnerships/Innovating-
finance), we showed that the Synop FSOI per datum in the Pacific Islands is more than 4 times the impact per 
datum achieved in the US or Europe (Figure 6), and this is useful information to justify continued investment 
in such observations. Of course, high density observations over Europe have value for short-range European 
forecasts, and more observations just upstream, over the Eastern North Atlantic, would be very useful.

- various regions (CONUS denotes the Contiguous USA). 
FSOI also enables us to monitor and summarise how the contributions of different observing systems evolve 
over time. For example, Figure 7 shows such a plot for 2020 to June 2022. There are several features of interest: 
a) the increase of GNSS-RO impact (brown) with the implementation of COSMIC-2 assimilation in March 
2020 and Spire data in May - removed at the end of September (the Spire data were made temporarily available 
because of the Covid pandemic), b) the drop in aircraft numbers and impact (cyan) in March 2020 followed 
by a slow recovery (see Ingleby et al., 2021), c) the impact of Aeolus wind data (yellow dashed line, Rennie 
et al., 2021), which was about 4% of the total when introduced in January 2020, which is considered very large
