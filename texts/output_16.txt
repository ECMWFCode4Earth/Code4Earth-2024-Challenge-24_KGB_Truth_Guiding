uncertainty parametrization is identical to the one used in the ensemble forecasts (Lock et al., 2019), and it is 
added to the model of each ensemble member. Boundary and forcing terms are only partially represented with 
climatological SST perturbations. Land, sea ice and snow-covered surfaces are not explicitly perturbed. System 
uncertainty is not explicitly accounted for, but we attempt to reduce its amplitude by applying the same 4D-
Var system in each member as in the unperturbed analysis, apart from the differences in resolution and number 
of outer loops for cost considerations. 
There are several sources of bias in the current uncertainty estimates. Observation error amplitude and 
correlations are sometimes simplified. For example, we omit the spatial correlation of AMV observation errors 
for computational cost reasons and increase their standard deviations to compensate. More generally, it is 
conceivable that the lack of explicit spatial observation error correlations in other dense observing systems 
(e.g., microwave and infrared sounders) could be a significant source of missing variance in the EDA error 
budget (Liu and Rabier, 2002). Model error uncertainty is calibrated for performance in the ensemble forecast 
system, but in some areas, terms are omitted or reduced. For example, we reduce the perturbations in the 
boundary layer for stability, and there is also a lack of explicit perturbations to the surface fluxes (Leutbecher 
et al., 2017). Further omissions are a lack of perturbations in the land surface models, which will reduce 
boundary layer spread in the atmospheric boundary layer. 
The under dispersion of the cycling EDA system means we need to apply inflation to the covariances A and B 
calculated from the raw EDA at the point where they are used. For the background errors, B, currently a global 
inflation factor of 1.34 is applied when calculating background errors standard deviations from raw EDA 
spread values. This factor is heuristically derived from testing which covariance inflation gives the best 4D-
Var performance, both in terms of observation departures and medium-range forecast scores, and it changes 
over time with updates to the system. This multiplication is applied inside the analysis, where there is also a 
further modification of the amplitude to account for the difference in global variance at different inner loop 
truncations. 
A remaining question is whether the relative spread changes we see by comparing EDA's run in a simpler 
configuration, for example the lower resolution and fewer members used when assessing new observations, 
are representative for changes we would see in the full resolution system. This has been addressed in the 
context of designing lower resolution and fewer members EDA experiments, to test the impact of proposed 
changes to the full resolution system (Lang et al., 2019). In the majority of cases, the changes in the low-
resolution system are representative, with only a minority of changes requiring full resolution testing. For EDA 
observation impact studies, we can likewise use fewer members. Lower resolution will likely give similar 
results for most observation types, with the provision that certain observation types are more sensitive to 
resolution and need more resolution, for example TCo639 (18 km spacing) rather than TCo399 (29 km 
spacing). 
There are currently several areas of work being considered to improve the reliability of the EDA. These include 
improved model uncertainty parameterizations, better modelling of observation errors including horizontal 
correlations, and a reduction of the resolution gap between the EDA and the high-resolution analysis. By 
addressing the sources of unreliability while not inflating the cycling EDA, we aim to stepwise improve the 
reliability of the EDA.
