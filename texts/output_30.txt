Figure 15: Vertical profile of normalised percentage reduction in EDA spread for the U wind 
component in the northern hemisphere for experiments where the simulated data have been 
assimilated with and without initial perturbations (red and blue lines respectively) or real MW data 
have been added or denied (black and grey lines respectively) compared to a baseline with 4 MW 
sounders.   
One aspect not previously encountered in either the Aeolus or the GNSS-RO work was the question of how to 
deal with observational biases for the simulated data. Observational biases are a common feature in the 
assimilation of radiance observations, arising, for instance, from systematic errors in the calibration or the 
observation operator. For real data, these are removed during the assimilation using Variational Bias 
Correction (VarBC). For the simulated data, we made no attempt at modelling such observational biases. This 
was a pragmatic decision, motivated by the fact that any modelling of bias structures would be highly 
speculative and subject to the maturity of the level-1 processing of the new data. To avoid that the EDA treats 
the new observations as anchors for the bias correction of other observations, we however activated VarBC 
for the new observations, so required the system to estimate bias correction parameters. Corrections to the 
small satellite data remained stable and small in magnitude compared to those applied to real MW data as 
expected. The approach used is considered equivalent to assuming that there are no significant biases that are 
systematic for all satellites across the constellation, and that inter-satellite biases for a given channel average 
out to near zero when all satellites are considered together. In terms of global biases, this is consistent with the 
current experience from, for instance, AMSU-A, MHS, or ATMS data. The approach is also justified by 
assuming that the constellations considered complement a backbone observing system of MW sounders which 
could be used for inter-calibration exercises. Nevertheless, it remains an open question to what extent 
observational biases and their treatment through VarBC affect the EDA spread - an aspect that would be worth 
investigating further in the future.
