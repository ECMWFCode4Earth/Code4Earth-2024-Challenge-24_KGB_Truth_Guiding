Some previous EDA studies 
4.2.1. 
Early Aeolus studies  
The application of EDA techniques for assessing new observing systems was introduced by Tan et al. (2007) 
to estimate the potential impact of Aeolus line of sight (LOS) wind profile information in the ECMWF system. 
Their key insight was that the EDA computations – unlike OSSEs – could be performed with a mixture of both 
real and simulated measurements. This means that only the new observing system needed to be simulated.  
It was recognised that OSSEs can potentially provide an estimate of the “absolute observation impact”, because 
the simulated truth is known from the nature run (NR).  In contrast, they noted that estimating the absolute 
impact of an observing system from the EDA computations would require careful calibration. However, it was 
argued that when comparing two observing systems, absolute calibration is unimportant, as it simplifies to a 
common rescaling of the spread values.  
The study mainly focussed on the impact on analyses and short-range forecasts, but showed a zonal wind 
spread at day-5. They emphasised potentially large impact in the tropics. The possible reasons for the EDA 
under dispersion were discussed, where it was noted the model error was not explicitly accounted for in the 
EDA at the time, and that spatial correlations of observation errors were only included when assimilating 
SATOB AMV wind information.  
It is difficult to compare EDA results from 2007 (investigating a period in 2003) with recent OSEs directly, 
but Rennie et al. (2021) have subsequently demonstrated significant impacts assimilating Aeolus 
measurements in the ECMWF system. The latest extended experiments, now spanning over 2 years using 
reprocessed Aeolus data, show statistically significant improvements in the northern/southern hemisphere 
Z500 out to day 4, and improved tropical winds out to day 8-9 (e.g., 200, 100 hPa).  
4.2.2. 
GNSS-RO impact with observation number 
Harnisch et al. (2013) applied the EDA method to estimate the impact of increasing the number of GNSS-RO 
measurements. The question at that time was whether there would be additional benefit from increasing the 
measurement numbers above the present levels of ~2500 occultations per day. Poli et al. (2008) had already 
demonstrated that the GNSS-RO impact on humidity and geopotential forecast errors was reduced when only 
half of the available GNSS-RO measurements were assimilated, but it was not clear how the impact might 
scale beyond the current numbers, or where “saturation” of impact might occur.  
The EDA experiments covered the period July-August, 2008, and were performed for the ~2500 real GNSS-
RO observations per day available at that time, and 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, 32000, 64000 and 128000 
simulated GNSS-RO measurements per day. 
The large range of the GNSS-RO numbers was intended to investigate the possible onset of saturation of 
GNSS-RO impact, but the key result from the study was that the EDA spread values continued to reduce, even 
when moving from 64,000 to 128,000 simulated observations (Figure 9). (Note that the economic case for 
extending the GNSS-RO numbers to 128,000, versus other possible non GNSS-RO changes to GOS, was not 
considered or discussed in this work.)
