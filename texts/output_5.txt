Predicting the impact of a future observing system for NWP is very difficult with any method, because the 
overall signal will usually be relatively small when the measurements are added to the full observing system. 
In fact, it is recognised that assessing impact of real observations can now be challenging, because the NWP 
systems are already well constrained and skilful. Ideally, we want to demonstrate a statistically significant 
impact in the medium-range from a new observing system, but this can be difficult to achieve in a reasonable 
timeframe, so often a balanced judgment based on shorter-range forecast improvements and consistency with 
other observations, is required prior to operational use. It is useful to initially describe how real observations 
are evaluated, before explaining how we try to estimate the impact of a future system with the EDA.  
In Section 2, we review how real observations are assessed, using both Observing System Experiments (OSEs) 
and the Forecast Sensitivity to Observation Impact (FSOI) approach.  Both methods are routinely used to 
quantify the impact of components of the existing observing system, and they help support choices about the 
future evolution of the GOS based on current impact.   
The main role of the EDA in the IFS is to provide flow dependent uncertainty information in the HRES system 
and contribute to the representation of initial condition uncertainties used in the ensemble forecasts. We review 
the key aspects of the EDA in Section 3, with a focus on understanding the sources of the EDA “spread”, the 
current need to inflate the spread values when constructing the covariance matrices used in operations, and the 
possible reasons for this “under dispersion”.   
In Section 4, we present the use of the EDA for assessing new observing systems. The similarities with 
theoretical 1D-Var information content studies are noted. Previous EDA studies by Tan et al. (2007) and 
Harnisch et al. (2013) are briefly reviewed. Two recent studies funded by ESA, investigating the short-range 
forecast spread-skill relationship for real GNSS-RO observations (Section 4.3), and assessing the impact of a 
proposed constellation of microwave sounders on small satellites (Section 4.4), are then summarised. 
Importantly, both studies have compared the spread reductions achieved with simulated and real observations, 
and they have shown good consistency. 
Section 5 is a summary.

Assessing the impact of existing observing systems 
Assessing the impact of existing observations can provide important insights into how the global observing 
system should evolve. In this section, we review how we assess existing systems with using Observing System 
Experiments and the Forecast Sensitivity to Observation Impact method.  
2.1 
Observing System Experiments 
An observing system experiment (OSE) measures the impact of a change in the real observing system. A 
denial experiment starts from the full observing system and removes one or more components. Denial 
experiments are used to assess the relative benefits of different types of observations. An addition experiment 
measures the impact of adding a new component to the existing observing system. These are used before 
deciding whether to activate a new observation type in the operational forecasting system.
