The EDA method for assessing new observations provides a theoretical estimate of the expected reduction in 
analysis and short-range forecast uncertainty, as a result of assimilating the new data. This information is 
usually averaged over large spatial scales and for periods of order a month, so the EDA results should be 
interpreted statistically.  The EDA is less useful for quantifying the impact of the new data on specific weather 
events or case studies. The method is similar to a 1D-Var information content study, but it is more general, 
because it is a cycling DA system which includes the forecast model, so we are also able to estimate the impact 
on variables that are indirectly related to the measured quantities (e.g., wind impact from MW sounders). The 
current operational EDA is known to be under-dispersive, and this means that the absolute impact of new 
observations is likely to be underestimated. However, future assessments of new observations will 
automatically benefit from improvements in the operational EDA system. In addition, it is usually argued that 
we are comparing the impact of different observation scenarios in a given set of the EDA experiments, and the 
relative impact is important.  
The main results from the early Aeolus (Section 4.2.1) and GNSS-RO (Section 4.2.2) EDA studies are 
reasonably consistent with the subsequent achievements with real data. Aeolus has a good forecast impact for 
a single instrument, for example, improving tropical stratospheric winds out to day-9 (100 hPa). The GNSS-
RO impact on Z500 RMSE scores at short-range roughly doubled when testing COSMIC-2 and Spire (Figure 
10). However, direct comparisons between the EDA spread reductions and improved forecast scores at short-
range are sensitive to the choice of verifying analyses, as discussed in Section 2.1.1. We have also found that 
some of the percentage improvements in EDA spread given in the Harnisch study are not achievable today, 
because the global observing system has improved considerably since 2008, and the baseline “noRO” spread 
values are now much smaller. On the key question of saturation of GNSS-RO impact, Privé et al. (2022) did 
not see saturation when testing up to 100,000 occultations per day in OSSEs, supporting the EDA work.  
The impact of real and simulated measurements in the EDA system has been tested and the results are very 
encouraging from a methodology viewpoint. The direct comparison of real and simulated COSMIC-2 
measurements in the EDA (Figure 11) suggests we can predict the impact of new GNSS-RO data in the EDA 
accurately with the simulation code developed for the Harnisch study. In addition, the EDA response to real 
and simulated microwave data appears to be consistent (Figure 16). Overall, if a simulated dataset has realistic 
(o-b)s, and it is assigned a reasonable R matrix, these results suggest that the spread reductions will be similar 
to what will be achieved with real measurements with the same observation error characteristics.  
There are some outstanding questions that require further work. Firstly, it is clear that changes in the EDA 
spread values can underestimate the actual performance of the observations, particularly for GNSS-RO in the 
stratosphere (Figure 12). This is to be expected in general, because the EDA is under-dispersive. Areas being 
investigated to improve the reliability of the EDA include (Section 3.2): improved model uncertainty 
parameterisations; better modelling of observation errors including horizontal correlations; reduction of the 
resolution gap between the EDA and the high-resolution analysis.  
The different scaling factors required for GNSS-RO and microwave data (Figure 18), albeit for different 
seasons, requires investigation, particularly if we wish to compare different observing systems with the EDA 
in the future. The role of anchor measurements and bias correction may be relevant here. Real GNSS-RO
