Recent application to GNSS-RO  
We have recently completed an ESA study in collaboration with the Met Office and EUMETSAT, testing the 
combined impact of (~) 3900 COSMIC-2 and 6800 Spire GNSS-RO measurements per day in two NWP 
systems (Lonitz et al., 2021). The total number of GNSS-RO was ~13,000 profiles per day. The experiments 
covered the period January 1 to March 31, 2020. The main aim of the study was to determine the actual forecast 
impact of this real data, to help inform agency commercial data buy decisions. It was also used as an 
opportunity to compare the impact of simulated and real measurements in the current EDA system, and to 
examine the real EDA spread-skill relationship, as the GNSS-RO numbers increased significantly.  
Figure 10 shows the combined impact of the COSMIC-2 and Spire data on the Z500 RMSE scores in the 
northern and southern hemisphere extra-tropics, verified against both own analysis (a) and operations (b). The 
impact of GNSS-RO has roughly doubled at the short-range with the addition of the new data. This is 
comparable to spread reductions given in the Harnish study, which showed a factor of ~3 enhancement in the 
SH Z500 impact at short-range, when moving from 2000 to 16000 simulated observations per day (See their 
Figure 6b). However, as discussed in Section 2.1.1 (See Figure 3), the magnitude of the GNSS-RO impact at 
short-range is sensitive to the choice of verifying analyses, particularly the degradation seen when removing 
all GNSS-RO from the system, because these observations are used in the operational analyses. This
