Assessing the impact of observations

Technical Memorandum No. 916 
 
Clearly, the EDA must provide a theoretical estimate of the uncertainty reduction because the simulated 
measurements can reduce the spread values without improving the estimate of the atmospheric state. However, 
it will be demonstrated that real and simulated COSMIC-2 measurements produce very similar spread 
reductions in the EDA (Section 4.3.1). The key requirements are producing simulated observations with 
realistic short-range forecast departure statistics (o-b), and using an accurate estimate of the observation error 
covariance matrix, R (Linearity assumptions can break down if an inappropriate R matrix is used in the EDA).  
As the EDA is a cycling system, it estimates the accumulated impact from both the previous and the latest 
observations. The cycling also means we can estimate the impact of mass measurements on the wind field, for 
example how the GNSS-RO or microwave sounder measurements impact the tropical wind uncertainty 
estimates. This is not possible in a 1D-Var study. 
4.1.2. 
Relationship to OSSEs 
There are obviously many computational and technical differences with OSSEs, and we do not discuss OSSEs 
in detail here (see, Errico and Priv√©, 2018).  However, a key difference is that OSSEs can provide direct 
estimates of analysis and forecast error vectors, ùõÜùêöand ùõÜùêü, respectively. This is because the true state is defined 
by the nature run. In OSSEs, covariance matrices, like A and B, can then be computed from the statistics of 
these error vectors. In contrast, the EDA is a cycling, error propagation model that attempts to estimate the A 
and B matrices directly, without reference to a true state. 
OSSEs are computationally expensive when compared to the EDA, but it can be argued that they should 
potentially provide a more comprehensive assessment of the observation impact. We would argue that having 
access to both EDA and OSSEs when assessing a new observation should be beneficial, because the impact 
will differ from system to system. On the interpretation of OSSEs, Errico and Priv√© (2018) make many of the 
same points made in Section 2 for OSEs. In particular, they note that OSSEs provide statistical information on 
the observation impact. The impact of the new observations when added to the full observing system may be 
‚Äúmodest‚Äù, but using a reduced observing system will provide misleading results. Case studies from OSSEs do 
not generally provide robust statistics from which to draw confident conclusions. ‚ÄúLegitimate‚Äù OSSEs are 
unlikely to provide ‚Äúextraordinary impacts‚Äù, and decision makers should have reasonable expectations about 
the new data.
