benefits, more than doubling the impact of MW sounders compared to the Metop/JPSS baseline. 
As we know from OSEs, this is a very significant impact (Duncan et al., 2021).  
2. There is a clear added benefit from the temperature sounding channels (compare red and black 
data points), highlighting the value of a more complex instrument that includes such capabilities. 
The benefit from temperature-sounding capabilities most likely results from the effective noise 
reduction due to repetitive measurements: for MW temperature-sounding, the size of typical errors 
in the background is comparable to that of the instrument noise of the available observations, 
hence reducing the effective noise is especially beneficial.  
3. As in the case of the GNSS-RO data, the rate of the spread reduction decreases for larger 
constellations, with the shape of the curve broadly similar to that seen for the GNSS-RO data.  
The EDA also captures that the assimilation of MW-sounding observations leads to improvements for wind 
forecasts, through the ability of 4D-Var to infer information on the dynamics from observations primarily 
sensitive to temperature, humidity, and clouds. This is highlighted in Figure 17, which shows the EDA spread 
reduction for the Northern Hemisphere and the Tropics for some selected constellations. The relative benefit 
for wind of adding temperature-sounding channels to the humidity-sounding channels differs between the two 
regions shown (compare, for instance, the purple solid and dashed lines). The different importance is consistent 
with the primary mechanisms considered relevant for obtaining wind information: over the Tropics, the 
humidity-sounding channels play a larger role, via the 4D-Var humidity/cloud tracing, whereas over the extra-
tropics there is more significant benefit from the temperature-sounding channels, as geostrophic balance 
becomes a leading mechanism. The real data show a similar behaviour (compare the solid black and dotted 
lines), and the finding is also consistent with experiences from OSEs. It is reassuring that the EDA captures 
these different behaviours. 
 
Figure 17: Change in the EDA spread relative to the Metop/JPP constellations for the u-component 
of wind over the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropics (left) and the Tropics (right) for the 
constellations listed in the legend. Dashed lines indicate experiments with humidity-sounding only, 
whereas solid lines indicate combined use of temperature and humidity-sounding. 
One rather practical aspect encountered during the study was the role of thinning applied prior to the 
assimilation of MW-sounding data. In line with current practice for real data, observations for the simulated
