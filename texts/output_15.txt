Overweighting an observation type can lead to a misleadingly large FSOI for that observation type. In 
situations where an observation type is over-weighted to the extent that it gives negative impact in an OSE, 
FSOI may misleadingly suggest particularly large positive influence from this observation type relative to 
others (Lupu et al., 2015). FSOI therefore requires careful analysis to avoid misinterpretation, and ideally it 
should be used alongside OSEs. 
In general, FSOI has a less important role at ECMWF when assessing whether a new observing system should 
become operational, and the relevant OSEs are used instead for this decision. FSOI is used primarily for 
diagnostic purposes. For these, either the operational database of FSOI values for each observation is available, 
or dedicated RD experiments can be run. FSOI is not calculated by default for RD experiments.

Ensemble of Data Assimilations 
We use the EDA system in the assessment of new observations, but the EDA is primarily designed to provide 
flow dependent uncertainty information. This section outlines the EDA method and how it is used in the main 
applications.  
3.1 
Method 
The Ensemble of Data Assimilations (EDA) (Isaksen et al., 2010; Bonavita et al., 2016) has the dual role of 
providing flow dependent covariance estimates for the hybrid 4D-Var system, and it contributes to the 
estimation of the initial conditions used in the ensemble forecasting system (ENS). In the EDA, each perturbed 
ensemble member performs an independent 4D-Var analysis update (Courtier et al., 1994; Rabier et al., 2000). 
The EDA is a variational implementation of a Monte Carlo approximation to the standard Kalman filter 
(Houtekamer and Mitchell, 1998), also known as the perturbed observations ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), 
where observations in each member are perturbed according to their assumed observation error covariances.

EDA Spread: Source and reliability 
In theory, if all sources of uncertainty in the assimilation system are accurately sampled, the analysis and 
background covariance matrices, given as (A, B), respectively, sampled from the ensemble members are, on 
average, unbiased estimators of the error covariances of the system. In practice, the “raw spread” calculated 
directly from EDA members is lower than the corresponding error statistics estimated from cross validation or 
spread-skill relationships (see Bonavita et al., 2016). This “under dispersion” of the EDA is common to 
most/all operational ensemble data assimilation systems, and most employ methods for covariance inflation, 
typically multiplicative or additive inflation (see review by Houtekamer and Zhang, 2016). At ECMWF, 
however, there is no inflation of the cycling EDA members, and the focus is on improving the modelling of 
the sources of uncertainty.  
The “reliability” characteristics of the ECMWF EDA are thus dependent on our ability to model the sources 
of uncertainty, including observation errors, model uncertainty, boundary and forcing term uncertainty and 
system uncertainty (see Houtekamer and Zhang, 2016, Table 4, for a list of error sources). Observation 
uncertainty is modelled by the perturbed observation approach that adds random perturbations with the 
standard deviation of the assumed observation error to the observations used in each member. The model
