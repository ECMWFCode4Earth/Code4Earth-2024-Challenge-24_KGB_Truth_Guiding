Method: simulation of observations used in EDA 
 
Figure 8: Typical simulation system used to produce observations for the EDA computations. Note 
that errors are added both in this simulation step and later during the EDA.  
The EDA computations require a simulated dataset generated with a system illustrated in Figure 8. There are 
three main steps. High quality atmospheric state information is interpolated to the observation locations. A 
forward model maps the state information to observation space. Noise is added to the simulated data and it is 
stored ready for assimilation alongside real data. 
There have been differences over time in how this simulation system has been implemented at ECMWF as 
understanding has evolved. For example, Tan et al. (2007) used Met Office short-range forecast information 
to ensure that the (o-b) departures were realistic. Subsequent studies used operational ECMWF analyses, but 
at higher resolution than the EDA. Harnisch et al. (2013) used a 2D bending angle operator to simulate the 
data, but a 1D operator to assimilate it, in order to introduce a realistic forward model error. The recent 
microwave sounder study in Section 4.4 uses the same observation operator (RTTOV-SCATT) to simulate 
and assimilate the radiances, but with different surface emissivity information over land and sea-ice. The 
advantages of using different forward models to simulate and assimilate the observations are not clear. 
There are still some open questions on the importance and role of the noise added in the simulation step. We 
have to consider whether it should include just instrument noise, E, or both instrument noise and representation 
error, R=E+F, and how to model these. The GNSS-RO work usually adds perturbations that explicitly include 
both components, whereas for the MW sounder work it was found that realistic background departures can be 
achieved for the simulated observations when only instrument noise is explicitly considered, with 
representation error arising implicitly in the observation simulations. Introducing realistic biases for observing 
systems that are likely to require bias correction also needs some consideration.
