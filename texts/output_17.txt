Use of EDA in Ensemble Forecasts 
Buizza et al. (2008) examined ensemble initial conditions based on the EDA. They found that initial 
perturbations based solely on the EDA did not generate sufficient ensemble spread to obtain reliable ensemble 
forecasts. Their study also looked at the combination of initial perturbations based on the EDA and 
perturbations based on the leading initial singular vectors (SV), which led to a larger ensemble spread that 
better matched the growth of the error of the ensemble mean. The combination of EDA and singular vector 
perturbations has been used operationally since 2010, and the amplitudes of the singular vector perturbations 
have not changed significantly since 2011. The need for this kind of inflation may disappear with future 
improvements in the EDA reliability, but it currently has implications for using the EDA to estimate the 
medium-range impact of new observations (Section 4.5).

Using the EDA to estimate the impact of new observing systems 
As discussed in Section 3, the cycling EDA system is designed to provide flow dependent covariance 
information. Currently, like most operational ensemble-based DA systems, it is under dispersive, so in practice 
the “raw” covariance matrices have to be inflated for operational use in the 4D-Var, and singular vectors are 
still required in combination with the EDA when initialising the ensemble forecasts. 
In this section, we outline how the EDA is used to assess the impact of new observing systems and provide 
examples from previous and ongoing work. In this application, we are investigating how the new simulated 
observations change the estimates of the analysis and short-range forecast error statistics provided by the EDA 
These changes in the error statistics are usually averaged over both large spatial scales and over a period of 
around a month, so it is a large scale, statistical measure of the observation impact. The EDA method does not 
provide a useful framework for assessing how the new observations improve forecasts of specific, high impact 
weather events.  
Ideally, we would like to estimate the impact of the observations on the medium-range forecasts, but the EDA 
observation studies usually focus on the analysis and short-range, because the observation impact is clearest 
there. Currently, the EDA method is not ideal for the assessment of medium-range impact. It can be extended 
to longer forecast ranges (Section 4.5), but the interpretation of these results is more complicated, because the 
singular vectors needed in the ensemble system to achieve reliability are not included in the EDA.

Information content interpretation 
The use of the EDA for assessing new observing systems can be interpreted as a 4D-Var information content 
approach, analogous to 1D-Var studies (e.g. Rodgers, 2000). It provides a theoretical estimate of how the 
(cycling) analysis and short-range forecast error statistics (A and B, respectively) should respond to 
assimilating a new set of observations. In the linear limit, these changes in the error statistics are dependent on 
the assumed observation error covariance, R, rather than the values of the new observations, y.
