Figure 18: Scatter plot of the variance of the radiosonde (O-B) and variance of the EDA spread for 
temperature at 100 hPa (left) and 500 hPa, both Northern Hemisphere (right). 
The slope values have also been compared to those obtained from the GNSS-RO study, and the values differ 
considerably, with the GNSS-RO scaling factors typically larger than the ones for the MW. However, the two 
studies were conducted over different seasons and years (June 2018 for the MW work, and January-March, 
2020 or the GNSS-RO work), so a direct comparison of the scaling factors is questionable, as at least some of 
the differences likely reflect seasonal and inter-annual differences in the performance of the EDA. In line with 
seasonal aspects playing a particular role, profiles of EDA spread for the two studies differed strongly in size 
for the extra-tropics when comparing the same hemispheres, but they were broadly similar when comparing 
spread values for opposite hemispheres. Values for the variance of radiosonde departures also showed better 
agreement for the opposite hemispheres. The relevance of the scaling factor and any similarities and 
differences for different observing systems nevertheless warrants further research. One aspect currently being 
considered is whether the spatial sampling of the different observing systems also influences these gradient 
values.

Medium-range impact assessment with the EDA 
Ideally, we would like to provide an estimate of the observation impact at medium-range, but the EDA studies 
usually focus on spread reductions achieved at the short-range where the observation signal is clearest. In 
general, if we reduce the errors at short-range, we are likely to improve the medium-range errors, but this is 
only considered a partial predictor of medium-range skill. We encounter a similar situation for the 
interpretation of FSOI, which also only estimates short-range forecast skill. In principle, we can extend the 
EDA spread calculations to longer ranges (without adding the singular vectors used in the ENS system) as part 
of the assessment studies. For example, Figure 19 compares the EDA temperature spread reductions achieved 
with real and simulated COSMIC-2 measurements at day-5. There is still reasonable consistency between the 
real and simulated data which is encouraging, and as expected the COSMIC-2 spread reductions are smaller 
than achieved at 12 hours (Figure 11).
