Observation-specific adaptations  
The new observations were simulated and assimilated in the all-sky framework developed for MW-sounding 
radiances (Geer et al., 2014, Duncan et al., 2022), using RTTOV-SCATT as the observation operator (Geer et 
al., 2021). The overall approach of simulating the new observations largely followed that of the recent GNSS-
RO work, that is, the observations were simulated from high resolution (TCo1279, 9km) ECMWF analysis 
trajectories. Over land and snow/sea-ice, where the assimilation of real sounding data relies on an emissivity 
retrieval from window-channel observations, alternative approaches to specify the surface emissivity needed 
to be used, as the emissivity retrieval is not possible. Here, values from an emissivity atlas were employed 
over snow-free land, and typical values over snow and sea-ice surfaces. The latter are relatively crude 
assumptions, reflecting the current lack of sufficiently accurate physically-based surface emissivity modelling. 
An important new aspect to address during the simulation of the cloud-affected brightness temperatures was 
how to treat representation error. For all-sky assimilation of MW radiances, this is considered dominant in 
cloudy situations, and this aspect is reflected in the situation-dependent observation error model used during 
the assimilation (Geer and Bauer, 2011). The observation error model assigns larger values in cloudy regions, 
dependent on a cloud indicator which characterises the presence of clouds in the observations or the 
background. Applying a similar model during the simulation of the new observations (prior to the EDA) was 
considered. However, during the course of the work it was found that adding random perturbations according 
to the instrument noise alone led to 4D-Var background departure statistics that were remarkably consistent 
with those of real observations. An example of this is given in Figure 14 which shows standard deviations of 
background departures as a function of the cloud indicator used in the observation error model. The good 
agreement is likely the result of several factors. One is chaotic error growth relating to clouds. Another is 
differences in the spatial resolution, as the brightness temperatures were produced using TCo1279 (9km) 
trajectories, but assimilated at lower resolution (TCo399, ~25 km, as in the EDA configuration), hence 
introducing some form of spatial representation error. Differences in the moist physics may also play a role, 
with the old physics parametrization used in the observation simulations, whereas the new moist physics 
(Bechtold et al., 2020) were used in the assimilation, hence introducing a representation error relating to the 
cloud-representation. Given these results, it was decided to only add random perturbations consistent with the 
specified instrument noise when producing the simulated observations. Note, however, that the perturbations
