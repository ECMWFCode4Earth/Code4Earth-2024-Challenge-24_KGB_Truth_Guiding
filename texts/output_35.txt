Figure 19: As Figure 11 but showing day-5 EDA temperature spread reductions for real (red line) 
and simulated (green line) COSMIC-2 measurements. This includes a revised error model for 
simulated data (black line), which gives better consistency with the real data for 12 hr spread values.  
An open question is whether the day-5 spread estimates provide useful additional information, given that we 
know the EDA alone does not fully characterise the forecast error statistics in the medium-range, and that 
singular vector-based perturbations are needed to obtain a reliable ensemble forecast (Section 3.3). Also, to 
obtain statistically significant spread differences, we would probably need to run longer experiments, which 
would increase the cost of the EDA experimentation.

New/planned activities  
Two new EDA studies started in June 2022, through a EUMETSAT-funded activity. In these studies, we will 
consider two potential future missions, namely the EPS-Sterna constellation and a future Doppler Wind Lidar 
as Aeolus follow-on. A new aspect is that both missions will be investigated in a consistent way, over the same 
period, using the same baseline observing system of real observations. This will allow cross-comparisons of 
the impact and investigations into the complementarity of these missions. We have not previously performed 
such comparisons of different observing systems with the EDA-method. Given the potential differences in 
scaling factors when translating EDA spread results into forecast error reductions noted earlier, such 
comparisons will require some care.  
EPS-Sterna Constellation 
The EPS-Sterna constellation consists of a fleet of small satellites with cross-track scanning MW instruments, 
with temperature and humidity sounding capabilities in the 50, 183, and 325 GHz bands. It is intended to 
complement the 3-orbit CGMS baseline, to provide better temporal sampling for MW sounding. The 
requirements for the constellation are currently being refined by EUMETSAT in collaboration with ESA, users 
and industry, for instance, in terms of the number of orbits covered, satellites flown, and expected instrument 
performance.
